    "Basic Components of a Digital Image\n",
    "A digital image is a numerical representation of a visual scene that consists of small units called pixels (picture elements). These pixels collectively form an image and store intensity or color information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key components of a digital image include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixels (Picture Elements):\n",
    "The smallest unit of an image, each containing intensity or color information.\n",
    "Resolution:\n",
    "The number of pixels in an image (e.g., 1920×1080 pixels). Higher resolution means more detail.\n",
    "Bit Depth:\n",
    "Defines the number of bits used to store pixel information. Higher bit depth allows more shades or colors (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit).\n",
    "Color Representation:\n",
    "Images can be grayscale or color, depending on how pixel values are stored.\n",
    "Image Format:\n",
    "Common formats include JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF.\n",
    "How a Digital Image is Represented in a Computer\n",
    "A digital image is stored as a 2D array of pixels, where each pixel contains intensity (for grayscale) or color values (for color images).\n",
    "\n",
    "Grayscale Image Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pixel is a single intensity value (0 to 255 in an 8-bit image).\n",
    "Example: 0 = black, 255 = white, and intermediate values represent shades of gray.\n",
    "Stored as a 2D matrix of intensity values.\n",
    "Color Image Representation (RGB Model):\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pixel has three color channels: Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B).\n",
    "Each channel stores intensity values (0 to 255 in 8-bit images).\n",
    "Stored as a 3D matrix (Height × Width × 3)."

    "# 2. Define Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and discuss their role in image processing.Describe the key advantages of using CNNs over traditional neural networks for image-related tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:-\n",
    "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized deep learning model designed for processing spatial data, particularly images. CNNs use convolutional layers to automatically learn hierarchical patterns such as edges, textures, shapes, and objects in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of treating an image as a flat 1D vector (as in traditional neural networks), CNNs preserve spatial relationships by using small local regions (kernels/filters) that slide over the image to extract important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role of CNNs in Image Processing\n",
    "CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Image Classification – Identifying objects in an image (e.g., detecting cats vs. dogs).\n",
    "Object Detection – Locating objects in an image (e.g., autonomous vehicle detection).\n",
    "Face Recognition – Matching faces in security systems (e.g., Face ID).\n",
    "Medical Imaging Analysis – Detecting diseases from X-rays or MRIs.\n",
    "Image Segmentation – Dividing an image into meaningful parts (e.g., self-driving car lane detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Advantages of CNNs Over Traditional Neural Networks\n",
    "1. Spatial Feature Learning (vs. Fully Connected Layers)\n",
    "Traditional Neural Networks: Flatten images into 1D vectors, losing spatial relationships.\n",
    "CNNs: Preserve spatial structure by processing small local regions using filters.\n",
    "2. Parameter Efficiency (vs. Fully Connected Layers)\n",
    "Traditional fully connected networks require millions of parameters for high-resolution images.\n",
    "CNNs use shared weights (convolution filters), drastically reducing the number of parameters and improving efficiency.\n",
    "3. Automatic Feature Extraction (vs. Manual Feature Engineering)\n",
    "Traditional approaches require manual feature extraction (e.g., edge detection with Sobel filters).\n",
    "CNNs automatically learn low-level features (edges), mid-level features (shapes), and high-level features (objects).\n",
    "4. Translation Invariance (vs. Position Sensitivity)\n",
    "CNNs recognize patterns regardless of their position in the image (important for detecting objects in different locations)."

    "Padding is used to add extra pixels (usually zeros) around the image before convolution.\n",
    "Types of Padding:\n",
    "Valid Padding (No Padding): Shrinks the output size.\n",
    "Same Padding (Zero Padding): Keeps the same size as input.\n",

    "Stride = 1: Moves one pixel at a time (fine-grained detection).\n",
    "Stride = 2 or more: Moves multiple pixels (reduces feature map size, speeds up computation).\n",
