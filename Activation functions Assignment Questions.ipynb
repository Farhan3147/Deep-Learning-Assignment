    "Significance of Activation Functions in Hidden Layers of a Neural Network\n",
    "Activation functions in the hidden layers of a neural network are crucial for enabling the network to learn complex patterns and representations. Without activation functions, a neural network would behave like a simple linear model, regardless of the number of layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Roles of Activation Functions in Hidden Layers\n",
    "1. Introducing Non-Linearity\n",
    "Real-world data often exhibits complex, nonlinear relationships.\n",
    "Activation functions break linearity and allow neural networks to learn from nonlinear patterns.\n",
    "Without them, multiple layers would collapse into a single linear transformation.\n",
    "2. Enabling Deep Learning Capabilities\n",
    "Stacking multiple layers with activation functions enables a deep network to learn hierarchical features.\n",
    "Early layers learn simple features (e.g., edges in images).\n",
    "Deeper layers learn complex features (e.g., shapes, objects).\n",
    "Without activation functions, the network cannot extract meaningful features from data.\n",
    "3. Controlling the Flow of Information\n",
    "Activation functions determine which neurons should \"fire\" and contribute to the next layer.\n",
    "Functions like ReLU deactivate some neurons (output 0 for negative inputs), leading to sparse activations, which help in efficient learning.\n",
    "4. Preventing Vanishing or Exploding Gradients\n",
    "Sigmoid and Tanh activation functions suffer from the vanishing gradient problem‚Äîgradients become very small, slowing learning in deep networks.\n",
    "ReLU (and its variants like Leaky ReLU) helps avoid this issue by maintaining stronger gradients for positive inputs.\n",
    "5. Improving Convergence and Optimization\n",
    "Proper activation functions help in faster convergence during training by keeping gradients well-scaled.\n",
    "Functions like ReLU help avoid slow learning caused by small gradients.\n",
    "Common Activation Functions Used in Hidden Layers\n",
    "ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)\n",
    "Most widely used due to its computational efficiency and strong gradient propagation.\n",

    "Leaky ReLU / Parametric ReLU\n",

    "Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)\n",
    "Useful for zero-centered outputs, but still suffers from vanishing gradients.\n",
